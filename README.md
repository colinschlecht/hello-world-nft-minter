# ðŸ—ƒ Hello World NFT Minter

This project contains the starter files for [Alchemy's NFT Minter tutorial](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/tutorials/nft-minter), in which they teach you how to connect your smart contract to your React dApp project by building an NFT Minter using Metamask and Web3.

The repo is extended from the original project, combining https://github.com/colinschlecht/simple-helloworld-nft-minter in order to have a more end to end process from creation of the contract, to deploying an NFT. 

To make use of this repo, be sure to have an established account with Alchemy, Metamask, and Pinata before proceeding.

* Note, this project utilizes the Rinkeby test network rather than the Ropsten test network from the documentation for both projects.
